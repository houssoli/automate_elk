  - name: Template elasticsearch.yml
    template:
        dest: "/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml" # required. Location to render the template to on the remote machine.
        src: "elasticsearch.j2.yml" # required. Path of a Jinja2 formatted template on the Ansible controller. This can be a relative or absolute path.
        owner: undefined # not required. Name of the user that should own the file/directory, as would be fed to I(chown).
        group: undefined # not required. Name of the group that should own the file/directory, as would be fed to I(chown).
        mode: undefined # not required. Mode the file or directory should be. For those used to I(/usr/bin/chmod) remember that modes are actually octal numbers.  You must either add a leading zero so that Ansible's YAML parser knows it is an octal number (like C(0644) or C(01777)) or quote it (like C('644') or C('1777')) so Ansible receives a string and can do its own conversion from string into number.  Giving Ansible a number without following one of these rules will end up with a decimal number which will have unexpected results.  As of version 1.8, the mode may be specified as a symbolic mode (for example, C(u+rwx) or C(u=rw,g=r,o=r)).  As of version 2.6, the mode may also be the special string C(preserve).  C(preserve) means that the file will be given the same permissions as the source file.
        backup: no # not required. Create a backup file including the timestamp information so you can get the original file back if you somehow clobbered it incorrectly.
